## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Make scripts executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x *.sh
   ```
3. Run the setup scripts:
   ```bash
   ./SetupMac.sh      # System-level setup (requires sudo)
   ./SetupMacUser.sh  # User-level setup (no sudo required)
   ```

## üì¶ Using Makefile

For convenience, you can use the Makefile:

```bash
# System-level setup
make setup

# User-level setup
make setup-user

# Update system packages
make update

# Update user-level tools
make update-user

# Clear Xcode derived data
make clean-xcode

# Run all setup tasks
make all
```

## üîß Configuration

### Brewfile
The `Brewfile` contains all Homebrew packages, casks, and Mac App Store apps to be installed. Edit this file to customize your installation.

### Configuration Files
This repository manages your dotfiles and configuration:

**Shell Configuration:**
- `.bashrc` - Bash shell configuration (minimal, sources `.bash_aliases`)
- `.zshrc` - Zsh shell configuration (minimal, sources `.bash_aliases`)
- `.bash_aliases` - Common shell configuration (Homebrew, Ruby, PATH, Atuin)

**Git Configuration:**
- `.gitconfig` - Git global configuration (user info, GPG signing, editor, rerere, rebase settings)

All configuration files are symlinked to your home directory, allowing you to version control your configurations and sync them across machines.

### NetBird Configuration
By default, the setup script connects to `https://netbird-mgmt.instabug.tools:33073`. Modify `SetupMac.sh` if you need a different management URL.

## üìù Notes

- All scripts include error handling with `set -e` and `set -o pipefail`
